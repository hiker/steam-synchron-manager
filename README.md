# Steam-Synchron-Mmanager
A simple wrapper around some SteamWorks API calls.
Commands can be entered on the command line, and a reply will be printed
to stdout.

# Compilation
Use cmake:
mkdir bld
cd bld
cmake ..

The SteamWorks SDK must be installed either inside of this project, or
on the same level (otherwise define STEAM_DIR).
